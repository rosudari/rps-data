# rps-data
Dataset used for Rock-paper-scissors workshop.

Dataset is compiled from the following resources:
* [https://github.com/DrGFreeman/rps-cv-data-science](https://github.com/DrGFreeman/rps-cv-data-science#dataset)
* [Microsoft Kinect and Leap Motion Dataset](https://lttm.dei.unipd.it//downloads/gesture/)[1,2]
* [Creative Senz3D Dataset](https://lttm.dei.unipd.it//downloads/gesture/)[3,4]
* [Infrared images acquired by the Leap Motion sensor for Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog)[5]

The first resource is used in full, the others were hand-picked using the heuristic to determine if the gestures depicted are suitable for rock-paper-scissors game.
